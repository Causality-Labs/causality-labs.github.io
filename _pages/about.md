<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello everyone! I'm Ime Asamudo, an embedded software engineer with a degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Alberta, currently pursuing a master’s in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I’m passionate about applying embedded systems in diverse applications and have gained experience across bare-metal, RTOS, and Embedded Linux development.

I created this page to showcase the projects I've worked on and to share writing on topics that interest me. It also serves as a resource for others with similar interests who are looking for practical guidance. Topics covered here include developing Embedded Linux applications for various SBCs, FPGA work, RTOS and bare-metal development for different MCUs, and IoT subjects like BLE. If you’d like to get in touch, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/ime-asamudo/).
