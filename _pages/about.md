Hello everyone! I'm Ime Asamudo, an embedded software engineer with a degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Alberta, currently pursuing a master’s in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I’m passionate about applying embedded systems in diverse applications and have gained experience across bare-metal, RTOS, and Embedded Linux development.

I created this page to showcase the projects I've worked on and to share writing on topics that interest me. It also serves as a resource for others with similar interests who are looking for practical guidance. Topics covered here include developing Embedded Linux applications for various SBCs, FPGA work, RTOS and bare-metal development for different MCUs, and IoT subjects like BLE. If you’d like to get in touch, feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/ime-asamudo/).
